# Tailwind CSS Gradient Override Bug

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in Tailwind CSS involving unexpected gradient overrides.  The issue arises when conflicting styles interfere with the intended gradient rendering.

## Problem Description
When using Tailwind's gradient utilities (e.g., `bg-gradient-to-r`), the gradient might not appear as expected if other styles with higher specificity are applied to the same element.  This often occurs due to class order or unintended style conflicts.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully reviewing the CSS specificity rules and ensuring that the gradient classes have sufficient priority to apply correctly.

This often involves restructuring your class application or using `!important` (though this is generally discouraged).

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` to observe the buggy implementation.
3. Open `bugSolution.js` to see the corrected version.
4. Compare the differences and observe the impact on the gradient rendering.
