```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 ...">
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS's gradient functionality.  However, if the `...` contains conflicting classes affecting background colors or styles, the gradient might not render correctly or might be overridden unexpectedly.  This is especially true if the conflicting classes are applied later or have higher specificity.
