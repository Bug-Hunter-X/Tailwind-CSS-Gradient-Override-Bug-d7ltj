```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 relative z-10 ...">
</div>
```
In this solution, we've added `relative` and `z-10` classes. This might resolve the issue if the conflicting class has `absolute` positioning or a lower z-index.  Alternatively, ensuring that the gradient classes come after any potentially conflicting classes in the class list will often resolve the problem.
If neither of these fixes works, carefully check for classes that directly set background colors or styles and adjust accordingly.  Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the element and pinpoint the conflicting styles.
